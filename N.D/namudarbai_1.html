            <p> <font face="book antiqua">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum <br>has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a <br>galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five <br>centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was <br>popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and <br>more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem <br>Ipsum.</font></p>
